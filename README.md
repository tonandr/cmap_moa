# Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction for CMAP
## Additive margin and graph neural network based MoA prediction models.

These models was developed in the MoA Prediction contest hosted by Kaggle.
Via moa-camp.ipynb, drugs' clustering map for MoA can be checked in the case the additive margin loss was used.

## Status
First release. According to keras_unsupervised 1.1.13.dev1, these models will be modified.
